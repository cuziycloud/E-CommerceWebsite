This project is the final assignment for our course "Web Programming With NODE.JS", aimed at developing an e-commerce website. It is designed to test and demonstrate our knowledge of web development by integrating Node.js as the backend technology and utilizing a front-end framework of our choice.

The application will include core features, such as:

User Authentication: Allowing users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely.

Product Management: Enabling administrators to add, update, and delete products.

Order System: Facilitating the process of browsing, adding items to a cart, and completing orders.

We have the freedom to incorporate additional libraries and tools to improve functionality and user experience. However, the backend must primarily be developed using a Node.js framework, such as Express.js.

The project also includes a deployment requirement, ensuring the website is accessible and functional on a public platform. Deployment options include:

Hosting on services such as Heroku, Vercel, or AWS.
Containerizing the application using Docker Compose and providing the necessary configurations to run the project locally on any machine.
